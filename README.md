2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd online-shopping-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`).

5. Run the application:

   For development with live reloading:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   For development without TypeScript watch:
   ```
   npm run start-dev
   ```

   For production:
   ```
   npm run start-prod

### Docker Deployment

To build and push Docker images for production:
```
npm run push-image
```

This command compiles TypeScript, builds Docker images using the production configuration, and pushes them to the configured Docker registry.

## Scripts

The project includes the following npm scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and starts the server with nodemon for development.
- `npm run start-dev`: Starts the server with nodemon using the compiled JavaScript.
- `npm run start-prod`: Starts the server in production mode.
- `npm run push-image`: Compiles TypeScript, builds Docker images for production, and pushes them to the registry.
